# Team Generator
his script reads a csv file called 'teams.csv' and creates a list of tuples containing the team name and score. The list is then sorted in descending order by score. The teams are then evenly distributed into a specified number of team lists. The team lists are then printed and written to a new csv file called 'teams_out.csv'. The csv file is then transposed and written to another csv file called 'teams_out_transpose.csv'.

```sh
