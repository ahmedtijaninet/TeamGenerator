# Team Generator
This script generates fake team names and skill levels, then sorts the teams by skill level in descending order. The teams are then divided into 4 groups, with each group containing an equal number of teams. The group names and team names are then printed out and saved to a CSV file. The CSV file is then transposed and saved to another CSV file.

## Installation

To use this script, you will need to install the following packages:

```sh
pip install faker
pip install pandas
```
## Usage
To run the script, simply run the following command:
```sh
python team_generator.py
```
The script will generate the teams, print them out, and save them to CSV files. The resulting CSV files will be teams_out.csv and teams_out_transpose.csv.
